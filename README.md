# Toolset for processing PALM model data (tsfppd)

Toolset for processing PALM model data or tsfppd for short is
a Python library intended to streamline many of the pre- and
post-processing tasks related to PALM model simulations. It can
be directly used by the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks
written by the end user.

Under the hood, tsfppd utilises the xarray's multi-dimensional
data structures. Many of the functionalities use Dask to provide
scalability and performance up to billions of grid points.
